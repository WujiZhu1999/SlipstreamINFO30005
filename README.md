Expected way to communicate with google map API. We are going to use Google Map API/Direction through following steps.

    1.	In index.js contain these for cross domain: 
    a)	app.all('*', function(req, res, next) {
    b)	  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
    c)	  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'X-Requested-With')
    d)	  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'PUT,POST,GET,DELETE,OPTIONS')
    e)	  res.header('X-Powered-By', ' 3.2.1')
    f)	  res.header('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=utf-8')
    g)	  next()
    h)	})
    2.	In MapController.js
    a)	const axios = require('axios') for cross domain
    b)	const { data } = await axios({ url: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${req.query.origin}&destination=${req.query.destination}&key=${req.query.key}&region=${req.query.region}`})
    // then we will get the data back for route with sample response like this
    c)	https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start
    // then we can do the counting about route information which could present to users about route information and update personal records.

    For front-end presenting data, wonâ€™t considering that in this phase.


Alongside all this functionality users have been implement to compliment them

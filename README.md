# INFO30005Bike Slipstream 


TO LOG IN:
we havnt added a form to the webpage yet, so to log in do the following:
        use insomnia to send a post request to /login
                -have the form set to form url encoded
                -have parameters userName and password set to a username and password
        
        we have a route for register user (POST /login/register), but because it users the user controller, and we dont have a real database set up for now, it uses a separate instance of the users.js json model, 
        and so you wont be able to log in with users you create through this. This will not be the case for the next deliverable, as they will all access the same database

Functionality: A dashboard to show summarised users details regarding bike rides (energySaved,carbonSaved and streaks)
        Users

                deleting a new user (DELETE /users/:userName)
                fetching information about the user (GET /users/:userName) (We'll sort out what information we send later, it wont just be the whole thing)
                edit a user, changing something about them (POST /users/:userName)

            deleteing an article (forum/articleNum)
            editing a particlar article (forum/articleNum) using a post request
            create an article using a post request

        get a particular tip using a tipNumber (tips/tipNum)
        create a new tip using a post request 
        delete a tip pasted on a tipNumber (tips/tipNum)

        (we did not to a editing since we an assume this can be done manually)
    
    

Functionality: A map functionality where a route can be created linking to a MAP API

    URL: /map
        We have implemented:
                fetching a map (now is juts a text "Map") (GET /map/)
                get initial info of route from API (POST /map/)


        URL: /map/route
        We have implemented:
                deleting a route (DELETE /map/route)
                fetching information of a route (GET /map/route) 
                edit info of a route (POST map/route)
        
        URL: /map/finish
        We have implemented:
                finish a route and update personal record from that(POST map/finish)
Expected way to communicate with google map API. We are going to use Google Map API/Direction through following steps.

    1.	In app.js(entry point) contain these for cross domain: 
        >>	app.all('*', function(req, res, next) {
        >>	    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        >>          res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'X-Requested-With')
        >>          res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'PUT,POST,GET,DELETE,OPTIONS')
        >>          res.header('X-Powered-By', ' 3.2.1')
        >>          res.header('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=utf-8')
        >>          next()
        >>      })
    2.	In MapController.js we call google map api through passed in:
                1.Source
                2.Destination
                3.Key (our unique after we pay for the api)
                4.Region (Australia in this case since we are dealing with Melbourne bike path)
        Code:
        >>      const axios = require('axios') //for cross domain
        >>      const { data } = await axios({ url: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?                                       
        >>          origin=${req.query.origin}&destination=${req.query.destination}&key=${req.query.key}&region=${req.query.region}`})
        >>      //for example outcome(response): see https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start
        Then we can put the map(actual active map) through front end and update:
                1. personal info by calculating distance
                2. route info by response
        In this phase we mock up the API by array with just info about road and distance for which are enough for server side
        
    In this phase we won't actually implement then but just put

Alongside all this functionality users have been implement to compliment them
